# Introduction

Launch is a simple boilerplate project to help reduce the set up time of new static web projects. It provides a simple base of which websites can be built upon. It uses various tools, web technologies and frameworks to accomplish this - they are as follows:

- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Bower](https://bower.io/)
- [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/)
- CSS3
- [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html)
- [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/)
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)

## üêô Get Started

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

```

```
git clone https://github.com/manlikeemkay/launch.git .
```

3. Install build and application dependencies.

npm install
```

4. Build and serve the application (This will start a local server and point a browser to the correct address).
